# Stella-Regnum

Stella Regnum is a space-based PBeM in which players control an empire and "eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate".

- **Explore** means players send scouts across a map to reveal surrounding territories.
- **Expand** means players claim new territory by creating new settlements, or sometimes by extending the influence of existing settlements.
- **Exploit** means players gather and use resources in areas they control, and improve the efficiency of that usage.
- **Exterminate** means attacking and eliminating rival players. Since in some games all territory is eventually claimed, eliminating a rival's presence may be the only way to achieve further expansion.
